We investigate global dynamic feedback stabilization from a topological viewpoint. In particular, we consider the general case of dynamic feedback systems, whereby the total space (which includes the state space of the system and of the controller) is a fibre bundle, and derive conditions on the topology of the bundle that are necessary for various notions of global stabilization to hold. This point of view highlight the importance of distinguishing trivial bundles and twisted bundles in the study of global dynamic feedback stabilization, as we show that dynamic feedback defined on a twisted bundle can stabilize systems that dynamic feedback on trivial bundles cannot.
